# arduino-obstacle-detection

## Getting started

This repository contains the code that runs on the Arduino Controller of the Multi-Camera Blind assistive device. 

To get started, compile and flash the code `bluetooth_obstacle.ino` to an Arduino INO 3 controller.

Make the connections according to the code for the vibration motor, and the LiDAR obstacle sensor. 

The sensor used for obstacle detection is a LiDAR sensor, specifically the model `VL53L0X TOF Based LIDAR Laser Distance Sensor`.

Connect a battery of at least 9 V for the obstacle detection to function properly.
